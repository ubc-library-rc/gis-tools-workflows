# Tools and Workflows in QGIS
    

This intermediate-level workshop is focused on common tools and workflows in QGIS. Aims... Structure..l By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to set up a QGIS project, find and load data onto a basemap, edit vector data from inside the GIS interface, perform joins and selections, and answer spatial questions using basic vector analysis. 

## Before the Workshop

**Download QGIS** QGIS can be downloaded from [qgis.org's Downloads page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** instead of the latest release - currently **QGIS 3.34.6 'Prizren'**. This will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions. [See here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/content/installing-qgis.html) for further guidance.

[QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/index.html)

**Familiarity with the QGIS interface is prerequisite for this workshop.** Check out the Research Commons' [Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) if you are new to GIS, or your background is in Esri ArcGIS products.
