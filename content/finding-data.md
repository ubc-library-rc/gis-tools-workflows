# Finding Data

## Types of Geospatial Data
Geospatial data is often referred to as having two main types: **raster** and **vector**. These two data types, while both geospatial, are very different from one another. Raster data is data which is made up of pixels arranged in a grid, whereas vector data is made up of vertices and the paths between them – creating geometries that represent real-world features or phenomena. In other words, a vector data layer will be made up of either points, lines, or polygons. A third type of spatial data is **tabular data**. Tabular data are data formatted into a table by rows and columns. If the tabular dataset has columns referring to geometry such as latitude and longitude, then the dataset can be displayed in the virtual geographic space of a GIS. 

## Where to look
The data you'll need depends on your mapping objectives. 
Maybe you already have data. Maybe you want to create a reference map and all you need is contextual information and the ability to add some labels and markers. Perhaps your research lab is collecting the data. Local/global will inpact... whether final map is static, interactive, or simply the results of some spatial analysis. It's common to need administrative boundaries, 
Today's workshop will focus on municipal data repositories to practice searching and downloading data. 
Municipal and federal data repositories are a good place to begin looking for geospatial data. If you have access to a data repository, either through a group you’re working with/for or institutional library for example, reaching out to whoever coordinates on the matter can be useful. You can also begin with a web search and see what is returned. Lastly - making your own. 

## Considerations 
Whether you’re performing spatial analysis or making maps for yourself or a client, its important to keep a record of your data sources as you work. You’ll figure out a system that make sense to you. Trial and error a few times. However, The following considerations are useful to note somewhere like a document or notes file as you go.

```
- What is the dataset of and where did you download it from (save a link)
- What is the downloaded file called? Where is it stored on your computer/external storage device?
- Is there a visual data preview such as an interactive web map?
- What attributes are included in the dataset? 
- Who is the dataset published by and is there a contact for questions? 
- What is the dataset's license?
- When was it last updated?
- What formats can the dataset be downloaded in? 
- What projections can the dataset be downloaded in?
```
