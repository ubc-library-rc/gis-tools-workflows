This intermediate-level workshop is focused on common tools and workflows in QGIS. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to set up a QGIS project, find and load data onto a basemap, edit vector data from inside the GIS interface, perform joins and selections, and answer spatial questions using basic vector analysis. Familiarity with GIS is prerequisite for this workshop.
